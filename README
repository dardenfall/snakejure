# snakejure

Game snake, created for learning clojure.

## Usage

You can start game by executing game.sh (linux) or game.bat (windows).
I didn't test game.bat on windows, so I'm not sure it work properly. 
Or you can start game by invoking function "game" from ui.clj file, 
this function in snakejure.uo namespace.
To win game you must "lay" on every "noiser" (magenta rectangles) simultaneously. When you win game resets.

## Installation

You can see, that it's leiningen project, but I don't use leiningen it right know. 
I hope I'll start use it in future.

## Structure

There are 2 clojure files now. 
core.clj - contains basic functions, "business" functions :). 
	   They are responsible for changing state of the game.
ui.clj   - contains user interface functions. 
  	   They interact with user, create frame, timer, action listeners.

I'm planning to extract from core.clj all functions, which are responsible for modifying
mutable data (like update-smth). But I don't know now what name new clj file and namespace should have.

## License

I don't know. It seems to me, it's not very important now :)
