# snakejure

Game snake, created for learning clojure purpose.

## Usage

You can start game by executing menu.sh (linux) or menu.bat (windows).
Or you can start game by invoking function "show-menu" from menu_gui.clj file, 
this function in snakejure.menu-gui namespace.
To win game you must "lay" on every "noiser" (magenta rectangles) simultaneously. When you win game resets.

## Installation

You can see, that it's leiningen project, but I don't use leiningen it right know. 
I hope I'll start use it in future.

## Structure

core.clj - contains basic functions, "business" functions :). 
	   They are responsible for changing state of the game.
	   It also contains function, which creates apple, wall, noiser from point and
	   snake from seq of points (body).
game_gui.clj - contains functions, which creates and runs concrete level. 
menu_gui.clj - contains functions, which creates frame and displays menu, where user can choose some level.
	       It also creates panel by function from game_gui.clj and displays it.
level_loader.clj - contains functions for loading all levels from levels directory.
levels directory - directory with clj files, which represents levels.

Each level is a separate clj file with at least 1 public function - "level-description" with no arguments:
(defn level-description [] ...)
It must return map with following keys: :name :level-creator
:name - String - name of the level
:level-creator - function, which takes no arguments and returns map with following keys:

:walls - sequence of walls
:apple - map, representing apple.
:snake - map, representing snake.
:noisers - sequence of noisers.
:apple-generator - function, which takes snake and walls and returns new apple.
For example see basic.clj level.

## TODO
1. Extract from core.clj all functions, which are responsible for modifying
mutable data (like update-smth). But I don't know now what name new clj file and namespace should have.
2. Improve gui part of the game.
3. Add some 
3. Create more levels.
