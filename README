# snakejure

Game snake, created for learning clojure.

## Usage

Right now you can start game by invoking function "game" from core.clj file, 
this function in snakejure.core namespace.
To win game you must "lay" on every "noiser" (magenta rectangles) simultaneously. When you win game resets.

## Installation

You can see, that it's leiningen project, but I don't use leiningen it right know. 
I hope I'll start use it in future.

## License

I don't know. It seems to me, it's not very important now :)
