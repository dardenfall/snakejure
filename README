# snakejure

Game snake, created for learning clojure purpose.

## Usage

You can start game by executing game.sh (linux) or game.bat (windows).
Or you can start game by invoking function "game" from ui.clj file, 
this function in snakejure.uo namespace.
To win game you must "lay" on every "noiser" (magenta rectangles) simultaneously. When you win game resets.

## Installation

You can see, that it's leiningen project, but I don't use leiningen it right know. 
I hope I'll start use it in future.

## Structure

core.clj - contains basic functions, "business" functions :). 
	   They are responsible for changing state of the game.
ui.clj   - contains user interface functions. 
  	   They interact with user, create frame, timer, action listeners.
level_loader.clj - contains functions for loading all levels from levels directory.
levels directory - directory with clj files, which represents levels.

Each level is a separate clj file with at least 1 public function - "level-description" with no arguments:
(defn level-description [] ...)
It must return map with following keys: :name :level-creator
:name - String - name of the level
:level-creator - function, which takes no arguments and returns map with following keys:
:walls - sequence of walls
:apple - map, representing apple.
:snake - map, representing snake.
:noisers - sequence of noisers.
:apple-generator - function, which takes snake and walls and returns new apple.
For example see basic.clj level.

## TODO
1. Add levels. Every level must be in it's own clj file, and application will dynamically load them.
2. Extract from core.clj all functions, which are responsible for modifying
mutable data (like update-smth). But I don't know now what name new clj file and namespace should have.
3. Improve gui part of the game.
